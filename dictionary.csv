parameter,"A named entity in a function (or method) definition that specifies an argument (or in some cases, arguments) that the function can accept.",https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html
variable,Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.,https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.html
argument,A value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function. There are two types of arguments.,https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html
dictionary,"An associative array, where arbitrary keys are mapped to values. The keys can be any object with __hash__() and __eq__() methods. Called a hash in Perl.",https:docs.python.org/2glossary.html
tuple,"A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.html
ascii table,"ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.",http://www.asciitable.com/
module,A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.,https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html

float,They represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts.,https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_numbers.html
comment,"In Python, there are two ways to annotate your code. The first is to include comments that detail or indicatewhat a section of code – or snippet – does. The second makes use of multi-line comments or paragraphs that serve as documentation for others reading your code.",http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/comments/comments-in-python
